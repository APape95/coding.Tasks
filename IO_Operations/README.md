Welcome to the Student Management System project! This repository contains the codebase for a Python-based system designed to manage student registrations for various events, specifically exams.

## :open_book: Overview :open_book:	
The project consists of two main components:

:information_source: 1. Data Processing Module
This module, encapsulated in the dob_task.py file, handles the extraction and processing of student data from a provided text file (DOB.txt). The program reads the data and organizes it into two sections: one displaying student names and their corresponding birthdates, and the other listing all birthdates.

:black_nib:	2. Student Registration Module
The heart of the system lies in the student_register.py file, which facilitates the registration process for students attending an exam venue. This module prompts users to input the number of students registering and then iteratively collects their student ID numbers. Each ID number is then stored in a text file (reg_form.txt), formatted with dotted lines for use as an attendance register during the exam session.

# :footprints:	Steps :footprints:
To utilize this system effectively:
Ensure the text data file (DOB.txt) is correctly located in the designated directory.
Run dob_task.py to process the student data and generate the required sections.
Execute student_register.py to initiate the student registration process for the upcoming exam.
Follow the prompts to enter the number of students registering and their respective ID numbers.
